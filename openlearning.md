As a person who does a lot of autonomous learning, the Internet in these days offer a huge amount of possibilities to read/learn about any topic you might think of. The following is the courses I studied in NCU and Internet. There might be more the problem of filtering out useful/good content from the nearly infinite amount of sources. I will try to give a record of whatever I read/saw and can recommend on specific topics. I will also try to add specific links that I have already studied in the past but may help any interested reader (or myself as lookup). Most stuff will be about Operating System in general and more specific about Linux Kernel as my master thesis. But from time to time I might add also some more fun related topics.
