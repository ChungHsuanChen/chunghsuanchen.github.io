I  started a MS in Computer Science and Information Enginerring at the [College of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](http://www.ceecs.ncu.edu.tw/) of the National Central University in Taoyuan, Taiwan in the team of Dr. Eric Hsiao-Kuang Wu .
I enjoy studying Linux kernel Design. Previously, I studied and practiced some kernel module such as device driver. 
I'm going to work at [Mediatek](https://www.mediatek.tw/) in WCS department August,2022.
Currently, I am dedicated to learning and wirting system software and operating systems.
If you are interested in Operating systems or system software ,we can have some discussion on interesting topics.
