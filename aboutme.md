I  started a MS in Computer Science and Information Enginerring at the [College of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](http://www.ceecs.ncu.edu.tw/) of the National Central University in Taoyuan, Taiwan in the team of Dr. Eric Hsiao-Kuang Wu .
I enjoy studying Linux kernel Design. Previously, I studied and practiced some kernel module such as device driver. 
Currently, I am dedicated to writing an operating system on Raspberry Pi2 and my goal is designing an hard real time RTOS.
If you are interested in Operating systems ,we can have some discussion on interesting topics.
